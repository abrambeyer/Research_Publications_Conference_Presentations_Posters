# Using Data Science To Manage An Acute Care Rehabilitation Department
##### [*Poster Accepted to ACRM (American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine) 2019 Annual Conference](https://acrm.org/meetings/2019-annual-conference/)

## Project Overview:
- Established long-term partnership with the Physical & Occupational Therapy Departments to identify strategies to collaborate and improve outcomes.
- Key pain points were demonstrating and advocating the value of the department, better understanding of productivity, and reduced unskilled consults (someone sent to PT/OT when unable or unready for treatment causing wasted time and money)
- Using exploratory analysis, benchmarking, trends and forecasting, identified areas for improvment and advocated for appropriate staffing, appropriate therapy doses and appropriate fiscal stewardship.
- Metrics developed and tracked:  Response to Referall, Adherence to Treatment Frequency, Readmission Rates, Productivity by RVU.
